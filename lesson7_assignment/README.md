### Project Description:
In assignment 7, the basics of jQuery were introduced. DOM manipulation was used, teaching me how to change styles and areas of script and of a document. jQuery simplifies editing an HTML document by giving you a JavaScript library.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One lesson I learned was about how jQuery is a JavaScript library. With this library, manipulating HTML documents becomes much easier than before. The simple use of the '$' sign allows the user to gain access to the jQuery library. 
2. Another extremely important lesson learned during assignment 7 was the basis of what DOM manipulation is. DOM stands for Document Object Model and is quite helpful when asccesing and manipulating HTML documents. With DOM, I am able to access tags and alter styles of web pages. 
3. The third lesson I learned in creating assignment 7 was how to add in animation effects to a website. I was introduced to the hover() function which caused certain headers to light up when I hovered my moused over them. This is useful so you know exactly which header you are clicking. A further alteration to the hover was adding the display feature to the hover, that way when I hover over a header all of the information for that header is dropped down.
